          <h1>Peter 2.0: The Human Cyborg</h1>
          <p class="text">
            In 2017, Dr. Peter Scott-Morgan, a visionary roboticist, was
            diagnosed with motor neuron disease (MND). This degenerative illness
            would eventually paralyze him completely except for the movement of
            his eyes. However, Peter chose to fight back with technology and
            become Peter 2.0, the “world’s first human cyborg.”<br /><br />Building
            on this vision, Peter 2.0 v2 is a project I am working on that uses
            custom shaders written in GLSL to enhance the visual aspects of his
            digital representation, creating more immersive effects, while
            focusing on improving the overall aesthetic experience of his
            transformation.
